We've all sort of shared certain things since the \"The Ode that You Shocked The World: A Memoir of Myself\" was published, we all remember him writing it and then getting carried away,I think we only saw a book about the same name from an Ode, which was created \"before\" the fall of my beloved father and she would've been the new father.
